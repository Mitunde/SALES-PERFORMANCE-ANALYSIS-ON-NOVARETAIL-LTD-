## Recommendations
1. Replicate the September playbook: Perform a retroactive campaign analysis for September(promotions, stock levels, channel mix) and replicate successful tactics.
2. Invest in Lagos & Abuja market penetration: Lagos drives ~31.5% of revenue, prioritize marketing and inventory for Lagos. Abuja shows strong accessories volume, push targeted accessories promotions there.
3. Focus on retention programs: Returning customers deliver ~59% of revenue, build loyalty programs, repeat-purchase incentives, and targeted offers to increase lifetime value.
4. Leverage top sales reps: Study Abdul Salim’s approach (accounts, leads, pricing, negotiation) and replicate best practices (mentorship, commission structure). Consider targeted incentives to lift mid-tier reps.
5. Optimize discount strategy: Average discount per transaction (₦3,248) and total discount
(₦357,300) are reasonable, monitor margin impact during promo months; use targeted
coupons rather than blanket discounts.
6. Prioritize high-margin inventory: Since electronics yield high revenue per unit, ensure
consistent stock, warranty/upsell bundles, and premium service offerings.
7. Encourage repeat purchases among one-time buyers: Convert single-purchase customers
(~70% of customers) with follow-up offers, cross-sell emails, and small loyalty rewards.
8. Investigate Port Harcourt's impact: Since excluding Port Harcourt changes total revenue
materially, review operations/returns/late deliveries in that city and optimize logistics or
marketing spend accordingly.

## Conclusion
* The sales performance analysis provided valuable insights into NovaRetail’s operations across different cities and product categories.
By understanding where revenue comes from and which areas underperform, the company can make more informed decisions on marketing, inventory, and customer engagement
